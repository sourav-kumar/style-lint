CSS Lint:
A lint tool performs static analysis of source code and flags patterns that might be errors or otherwise cause problems for the developer.

CSSLint is a tool to help point out problems with your CSS code. It does basic syntax checking as well as applying a set of rules to the code that look for problematic patterns or signs of inefficiency. The rules are all pluggable, so we can easily write your own or omit ones you don't want.
